## Book API

This is a simple API I built to practice my knowledge on GraphQL. 
It does not connect to a database as everything is local.

### Languages

- Javascript

### Setup

- Clone the repository at [https://github.com/Extheoisah/bookAPI-graphQL.git] to your local machine

- ```cd``` into the bookAPI folder and run the script from the terminal with ```npm start```

- You should be able to see the program at localhost:5000 in your browser
